# Language Placing Gender Equality

Knowing the importance of how language could be used to fight for gender equality, the UN woman creates a gender-inclusive lexicon that includes 650 terms to promote a gender-friendly context and environment. Being interested in the idea and word database, I tempted to convert the static lexicon to interactive infographics in order to let users be able to search or learn the words effecitvely. The project is divided into three sections. The first one is for checking the terms which are categorized by the alphabet. The second part is creating the search area, so users can take the initiative to check if the words are included in the lexicon. The last part is to examin how many gender-friendly terms are inside thearticles, paragraphs, and speeches, so we can know how these terms are being used in certain kinds of contexts.
